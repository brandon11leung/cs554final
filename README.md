Welcome to Bird Spotter, an app to post and find the beautiful birds around you

Starting the App
The site backend is hosted with Azure and is already seeded and connected to redis
so to start just navigate to the client folder and npm i then npm run dev and navigate to http://localhost:5173/

Using the App
without logging in you can still view any posts and comments,
but in order to post a bird or comment you will need to log in

Click "Go and look at some birds" to view a paginated list of bird sightings
or click "View Map" to see the posts around you. Just click the map to jump to your location,
and click on the bird markers to view individual posts

On an individual post page you can see comments from users challenging the OPs classification of their bird sighting
You can click on the bird the commenter thinks it is to view more info about that species

If you think none of those comments have got it right either you can leave your own comment too.
write a quick note about what bird you think it is and why and then search for that bird and select it
from the menu. If someone has already suggested that bird you will not be able to suggest it again

If you do think a commenter has the right classification you can upvote their suggestion

you can also view some personal profile info by clicking "view profile info"
